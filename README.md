## Site Info

* Ludmilla-Mary is designed as a portfolio for a fictional character created by the artist 2fik . The purpose of the website is to encourage people to be fierce by embracing Ludmilla-Mary’s catwalk activism philosophy.  There is also a contact page which can be used to register to Ludmilla-Mary’s newsletter. Ludmilla-Mary’s website lends his character more complexity and anchors him even more in our reality. The website  is a touching, funny and insolent representation of Ludmilla-Mary. 
This website is targeted towards 2fik’s  art work supporters who follow Ludmilla-Mary’s tribulations. Ludmilla-Mary’s website will be useful for followers or newcomers to understand  her colorfull world. It is as well a  good illustration for an influencer parody portfolio where laughters are combined with curiosity.

* This is my Project Portfolio 1 submission for Code Institute's Diploma in Web Application Development course. Technologies used include HTML, CSS.

- __Tip__

  - Each page before the footer - except the confirmation registration page - has a little expression, which, if the user clicks, brings him to the next page. It is intentionally discrete so that the user may click by mistake and goes on with his discovery of the website. Otherwise, it has a semantic teasing in those expressions, playfull and welcoming.
