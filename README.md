## Site Info

* Ludmilla-Mary is designed as a portfolio for a fictional character created by the artist 2fik . The purpose of the website is to encourage people to be fierce by embracing Ludmilla-Mary’s catwalk activism philosophy.  There is also a contact page which can be used to register to Ludmilla-Mary’s newsletter. Ludmilla-Mary’s website lends his character more complexity and anchors him even more in our reality. The website  is a touching, funny and insolent representation of Ludmilla-Mary. 
This website is targeted towards 2fik’s  art work supporters who follow Ludmilla-Mary’s tribulations. Ludmilla-Mary’s website will be useful for followers or newcomers to understand  her colorfull world. It is as well a  good illustration for an influencer parody portfolio where laughters are combined with curiosity.

* This is my Project Portfolio 1 submission for Code Institute's Diploma in Web Application Development course. Technologies used include HTML, CSS.
