            <h1>Be Real</h1>
            <p>Don't be fooled! I'm not here to sell you the Instagram fantasy where perfection and accomplishment is a second nature. I might stop arrogant misogynist fools from perpetuating their archaic domination ego-trip with a little and efficient legwork. I do open up other's horizons when I bounce in the street. But I'm no revolutionary machine, neither a beauty on demand nor a body to feed upon relentlessly. Fierceness might walk you through a crumbling pavement but without connections to your inner feelings, you'll end up walking into the grave. Fierceness needs authenticity and you earn it when you assess your well-being and your true feelings. Behind my goddess appearance, there's a human-being that sleeps, eats and sneezes.</p>

                    <h2>Vacuity</h2>
                    <p>Sometimes, I sit on the stairs thinking of the vacuity of humankind. I feel the burden of the continuous avidity of the social media carnivores, waiting for me to stumble. Every shot of me feeds the beast and I find myself constantly wearing the mask of perfection where the fierceness allows me to feel blue. Those moments make me realize that I can misguide my attention. I'm not here for them. I'm here to entertain myself. I'm here to celebrate myself. I'm here because I'm worth it. Strike a pose, when you don't know anymore what drives you into the light. Be real to you. Don't be a hollow fierce doll. I always seize these moments of doubt to appreciate my inner spirituality and glide afterwards in the street like on a red carpet.</p>

                    <h2>Eat</h2>
                    <p>I'm not a cheerleader for anorexia: I do eat. Back in the days, I always encouraged Kate to eat more.You might see in me just as a covergirl, but my body is not limitless. In reality, I am also bound to my biological needs. That's why I always advise listening to the signals of your body. Looking bootylicious needs some fuel so I don't hesitate to eat as much as I want. I know that later I'll burn the energy, thriving through the crowd that glorifies me, myself and I and the intersectional social justice in this world. Never neglect your body. Eat, stretch and fart. Life is easier when your soul resides in an unrestrained flesh and bones palace. Confidence lies where your body feels at ease.</p>

                    <h2>Realness</h2>
                    <p>Validating your emotions and your moods is the key to realness. Don't bother to annoy people around you when you're having some ups and downs. Reality bangs like the oscillation of a respiratory monitor. Stick to your opinion unless someone succeeds in seducing you to feel otherwise. I couldn't care less about pleasing others when my well-being is on the line, as much I care less about marching against a totalitarian regime, high boots and gazelle legs to incarnate with my semiotics figure of a rebellish Marianne. Realness is to act according to your true motivation. So let me sulk over my dissatisfaction with my Jägermeister at the restaurant Coste, Centre Georges Pompidou. Don't worry, my hips won't lie later when I walk down the street.</p>

                    <h2>Rise up</h2>
                    <p>Beware, once you know what you feel, think and want, your realness check is done. Let yourself fiercely rise like a phœnix from the ashes to achieve all your goals. Your walk is your expression. Engage debates with your steps. Confront through the tip of your heel the society's bigotry. Break with your rolling gait the status quo that freezes the desire to require more of a life. Be fierce, be real, be me. Copycat is the new salvation. I invite you to connect  your core essence with your sassiness. Stand up and stay impetuously challenging. I, Ludmilla-Mary, am always an advocate of haughty bearing which prints the image such as the passer-by of Baudelaire: agile and noble, with a leg of statue.</p>
