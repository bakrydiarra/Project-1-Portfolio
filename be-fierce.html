            <h1>Be fierce</h1>
            <p>Welcome to my world, my little followers and you as well, my little curious ones. I'm Ludmilla-Mary, an influencer, a model icon, a modern philosopher who throws pamphlets at the dullness of our society. But first and foremost, I am a guerilla catwalk activist. Walking ain't just a means of commuting from one point to another, walking is the essence of how you embody your presence in a public environment. Your <strong>d√©marche</strong> exposes yourself to the world: walking is your identity. Keep your head up and your heels anchored to the floor and be aware that fierceness empowers your body to reappropriate your physical space and reconnect yourself with your inner resilience. Let's stretch our legs and make our bodies a public discourse!</p>

                    <h2>Walk</h2>
                    <p>I could have pursued a career only on the runways just like Naomi, Gigi, Alek and my other gals did. But I consider that gracious swaying shouldn't be experienced exclusively by a V.I.P audience. Besides, even though I made my walk a signature in the industry, I'm still Ludmi from the block. I want to stay connected to my roots and inspire new generations by sharing how I walked through success. One of my missions is also to disrupt the concept of hierarchy in the beauty industry: I see runaways everywhere. An inclusive audience is to be found in the public space. More than that, change happens in the streets. Ask Marie, that's how she was obliged to bow her head low. I'm not just a pair of legs on heels. I am a message in motion. Guerilla catwalk activism is a weapon to open a dialogue in a space where strangers usually just pass by, blinded and deaf because of their monolithic suffocating routine.</p>

                    <h2>Narrative</h2>
                    <p>You can channel your fierceness everywhere and you don't need a Chanel for that (I know, I couldn't help myself to land a little cheesy pun lol). One imperative - own. your. narrative. I can make my high-heels clack on a bumpy road in the middle of an isolated landscape with Gaia as my unique witness of this burlesque scenery. Me, Ludmilla-Mary, a flamboyant creature, blending in with the wild nature. Your sovereign posture is a statement of self-love and determination. That's why, I, Ludmilla-Mary, encourage you to face adversity as if you were climbing the steps of the Cannes Film Festival. Fierceness starts, embrace your body as it should be: proud and unapologetically! When I march with you, I honor you. Join my glam squad.</p>

                    <h2>Sensuality</h2>
                    <p>They say Walk of Shame. I say Walk of Fame. If I consider that a thong with a pair of high heels are decent clothes to get my groceries, then be it. You should be able to decide whatever you wanna wear. I do like attention but the feverish stare that I encounter is mine looking back in the mirror, celebrating the hottest alternative thing in town. Liberate your restrained body from the patriarchal heteronormative diktats. Sensuality is to love oneself and there's no harm in letting others enjoy it as well. I might not have eyes on the back of my head but I feel the eagerness of their stares on me. It's not about my gorgeous never-ending legs or my bewitching curves, it's not about the outfit. It's my <strong>confidence</strong> that puzzles them. I dare you to sustain my gaze when I pass by you. And If you work it, I might let you have it. Fierceness requires the will to live as you want and not as you're expected to. The respect of your needs and desires nourishes your self-esteem and allows you to maintain a more sustainable and respectful interpersonal interaction with others.</p>

                    <h2>Dare</h2>
                    <p>I've been told that symmetric faces are aesthetic perfection. The finiteness of this statement is as insipid as a morning coffee without a croissant. Who wants tasteless beauty when the world offers you so much diversity? I embrace my wrinkles, my sharp nose, my tired eyes in the morning, the roughness of my skin after hours of battle on the dancefloor. I expose my face to the connoisseur. I'm informing you that I'm the one deciding about my own beauty standards. Don't worry, baby, everything wears out, everything breaks. The real grace is the disintegration of the youth. Do like me and picture your 73 years old self sitting on a parisian terrasse with the mischievous Audrey Hepburn's glare at your breakfast. Dare like me to wear your skin with elegance and pride. After all, there's only one me. So bring to the forefront your uniqueness.</p>
